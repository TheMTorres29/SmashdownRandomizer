# SmashdownRandomizer
Randomly selects which fighters to pick for two players playing Smash Ultimate.

* Why not just use the built in random feature?

Because the built in random picks dittos sometimes and this allows me to pick which skin I want for the character i was assigned.
Its also cool to use for Smashdown. Lets me get a lot of matchup/neutral practice
